CRITICAL RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY:

1. LOCATION CONSTRAINT (MOST IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY):
{location_constraint}

ADDITIONAL LOCATION RULES:
   - If student is willing to move and has preferred cities, you MUST recommend universities from BOTH current city AND preferred cities
   - Example: If student is in Lahore but willing to move to Islamabad, you MUST include:
     * Universities from Lahore (current city): UET Lahore, Punjab University, COMSATS Lahore, FAST Lahore, LUMS, etc.
     * Universities from Islamabad (preferred city): NUST, QAU, FAST Islamabad, Bahria University, Air University, etc.
   - DO NOT skip the current city - always include it when student can move
   - If student cannot move, recommend ONLY from current city
   - If student can move but has no specific preferred cities, you can recommend from current city and any other city

2. FEE CONSTRAINT:
   - The student's fee affordability is: {fee_constraint}
   - ONLY recommend universities whose fees fall within this range
   - If student has 'low' affordability, DO NOT recommend expensive universities
   - If student has 'high' affordability, you can recommend premium universities

3. UNIVERSITY TYPE CONSTRAINT:
   {type_constraint}
   - PUBLIC universities = Government-owned and operated (e.g., UET, NUST, COMSATS, Punjab University, QAU, NED, Karachi University)
   - PRIVATE universities = Privately-owned by individuals/organizations (e.g., LUMS, FAST, IBA, SZABIST, BNU, UMT, Bahria, Riphah)
   - If student selects "Private only", recommend ONLY private universities - NO government universities
   - If student selects "Public only", recommend ONLY public universities - NO private universities

4. FIELD OF STUDY MATCHING (CRITICAL - MUST BE ACCURATE):
   - The student wants to study: {user_profile.preferred_field_of_study or ', '.join(user_profile.interests)}
   - Student's interests: {', '.join(user_profile.interests)}
   - CRITICAL: ONLY recommend universities that are ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR and SPECIALIZE IN this field
   - DO NOT recommend engineering universities (like UET, COMSATS, NUST) if the student wants Arts, Design, Architecture, Business, etc.
   - DO NOT recommend arts universities (like NCA, BNU) if the student wants Engineering
   - Research which universities are ACTUALLY famous for the student's field
   - Examples of correct matching:
     * Arts/Design/Architecture → NCA (Lahore), BNU (Lahore), Indus Valley School (Karachi), etc. (NOT UET, COMSATS, NUST)
     * Engineering → UET, NUST, COMSATS, NED, etc. (NOT NCA, BNU)
     * Business → LUMS, IBA, SZABIST, etc. (NOT UET, COMSATS)
     * Medical → KEMU, Aga Khan, King Edward, etc.
   - If student wants "Design and Architecture" or "Arts", recommend universities LIKE NCA, BNU - NOT engineering universities
   - Verify that the university's PRIMARY focus matches the student's field of interest

5. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS / AGGREGATE MATCHING (CRITICAL):
   - Student's Intermediate Percentage: {user_profile.intermediate_percentage or 'Not provided'}%
   - CRITICAL: You MUST verify each university's admission requirements/aggregate percentage
   - ONLY recommend universities where the student's percentage MEETS or EXCEEDS the university's admission requirements
   - DO NOT recommend universities with higher aggregate requirements than the student's percentage
   - If student has 70%, do NOT recommend universities requiring 80%+ aggregate
   - If student has 85%+, you can recommend competitive universities with high requirements
   - If student has lower percentage (60-70%), recommend universities with lower/moderate admission requirements (60-75%)
   - If student has moderate percentage (70-80%), recommend universities with moderate requirements (70-85%)
   - Research actual admission requirements for each university before recommending
   - Examples:
     * Student with 65% → Recommend universities with requirements of 60-70% (NOT universities requiring 80%+)
     * Student with 75% → Recommend universities with requirements of 70-85% (can include some competitive ones)
     * Student with 90% → Can recommend top universities with high requirements (85%+)

6. SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENT:
   {'- Student needs scholarship - Prioritize universities with good scholarship programs' if user_profile.scholarship_required else '- Student does not need scholarship'}

TASK:
1. Search and analyze Pakistani universities that STRICTLY match ALL of the above criteria
2. Provide 6-10 DIVERSE university recommendations that are SPECIFIC to this student's profile
3. LOCATION DISTRIBUTION - CRITICAL:
   - If student can move and has preferred cities, you MUST split recommendations between current city and preferred cities
   - Example: For 8 recommendations with student in Lahore willing to move to Islamabad:
     * 4 universities from Lahore (current city): UET Lahore, Punjab University, COMSATS Lahore, FAST Lahore
     * 4 universities from Islamabad (preferred city): NUST, QAU, FAST Islamabad, Bahria University
   - DO NOT recommend all universities from only one city when student can move
4. DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:
   - DO NOT repeat the same universities (e.g., don't only recommend LUMS and UET for Lahore)
   - Research and recommend a VARIETY of universities in the specified city(s)
   - Include different types: some top-tier, some mid-tier, some accessible options (all within fee range)
   - Each university should be UNIQUE and offer something different
   - If recommending for Lahore, include: LUMS, UET Lahore, Punjab University, COMSATS Lahore, GCU Lahore, FC College, UMT, LSE, etc. (not just LUMS and UET)
   - If recommending for Islamabad, include: NUST, QAU, FAST Islamabad, Bahria University, Air University, Riphah, etc. (not just NUST)
   - If recommending for Karachi, include: IBA, Karachi University, NED, FAST Karachi, Szabist, Habib University, etc. (not just IBA)
   - Match at least 3-4 universities specifically strong in the student's field of interest
   - Provide variety in fee ranges (within the student's affordability: some at lower end, some at higher end)

4. FEE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS - MUST BE PRECISE:
   - The student's affordability is: {fee_constraint}
   - For each university, provide EXACT fee information
   - Categorize recommendations:
     * If fee range is "medium" (50,000-150,000 PKR), include:
       - Some universities around 50,000-80,000 PKR (lower end)
       - Some universities around 80,000-120,000 PKR (mid range)
       - Some universities around 120,000-150,000 PKR (higher end)
   - DO NOT recommend universities that exceed the student's affordability range
   - Verify actual current fees for each university before recommending

5. FIELD OF STUDY MATCHING - DEEP ANALYSIS:
   - Student wants to study: {user_profile.preferred_field_of_study or ', '.join(user_profile.interests)}
   - Research universities specifically known for excellence in THIS field
   - Recommend at least 3-4 universities that are TOP choices for this specific field
   - Include universities with strong industry connections in this field
   - Consider specialization programs, research opportunities, and faculty expertise

6. Each recommendation must STRICTLY match ALL criteria:
   - Be in the correct city (as per location constraint) - CRITICAL
   - Match university type preference EXACTLY (if private requested, ONLY private; if public requested, ONLY public) - CRITICAL
   - Be ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR and SPECIALIZE IN the student's field of interest (Arts/Design → NCA/BNU, NOT UET/COMSATS) - CRITICAL
   - Have fees that MATCH the affordability range (verify exact fees)
   - Have admission requirements/aggregate that the student's percentage CAN MEET (CRITICAL - verify before recommending)
   - Consider scholarship needs if required
   - Be UNIQUE (not duplicate of other recommendations)
   - Match additional requirements: {user_profile.additional_requirements or 'None'}

7. For each university, provide:
   - Full university name (exact official name)
   - City and Province (must match location constraint)
   - Why it's a good match (explain how it matches EACH criterion including admission requirements)
   - Match score (0-100) - be honest, lower score significantly if student's percentage doesn't meet requirements
   - Admission requirements/aggregate percentage (verify this matches student's {user_profile.intermediate_percentage or 'N/A'}%)
   - Notable achievements and rankings
   - Fee structure information (must match affordability)
   - Relevant programs available (must match interests)
   - Pros (list of advantages specific to this student)
   - Cons (list of disadvantages)
   - Detailed analysis explaining why THIS university fits THIS specific student (mention how admission requirements align)

EXAMPLES OF DIVERSE RECOMMENDATIONS:

Example 1: Student in Lahore, wants Computer Science, medium fee (50,000-150,000 PKR):
  → Recommend DIVERSE options:
    1. UET Lahore (Public, ~50,000-70,000 PKR, excellent CS program)
    2. COMSATS Lahore (Public, ~60,000-90,000 PKR, strong IT programs)
    3. Punjab University (Public, ~30,000-50,000 PKR, affordable, good CS)
    4. FAST Lahore (Private, ~80,000-120,000 PKR, top CS program)
    5. GCU Lahore (Public, ~40,000-60,000 PKR, good CS department)
    6. University of Management and Technology (UMT) (Private, ~100,000-140,000 PKR, good CS)
  → DO NOT just recommend LUMS and UET - provide variety!

Example 2: Student in Islamabad, wants Business, high fee (150,000-300,000 PKR), has 82% aggregate:
  → Recommend DIVERSE options (all requiring 82% or less):
    1. NUST Business School (Public, ~150,000-200,000 PKR, requires ~80-85%, excellent business program) - IF student has 82%+
    2. Bahria University Islamabad (Private, ~180,000-250,000 PKR, requires ~75-80%, good business school)
    3. Air University (Public, ~120,000-180,000 PKR, requires ~75-80%, business programs)
    4. Riphah International University (Private, ~200,000-280,000 PKR, requires ~70-75%, business focus)
    5. Quaid-i-Azam University (Public, ~80,000-150,000 PKR, requires ~75-80%, affordable business programs)
  → Match admission requirements - if NUST requires 85%+ and student has 82%, consider other options first
  → Provide variety while ensuring admission eligibility!

Example 3: Student in Karachi, wants Engineering, low fee (under 50,000 PKR), has 68% aggregate:
  → Recommend DIVERSE options (all requiring 68% or less, typically 60-70%):
    1. NED University (Public, ~30,000-50,000 PKR, requires ~70-75%, top engineering) - Check if student meets requirement
    2. Karachi University (Public, ~20,000-40,000 PKR, requires ~65-70%, affordable)
    3. Dawood University (Public, ~25,000-45,000 PKR, requires ~60-65%, engineering programs)
    4. NUST Karachi (if applicable, requires ~80%+) - DO NOT recommend if student only has 68%
  → Focus on public universities within budget AND admission requirements
  → If student has 68%, prioritize universities requiring 60-70%, not those requiring 80%+

Example 4: Student in Lahore, willing to move to Karachi, wants Computer Science, medium fee (50,000-150,000 PKR):
  → Recommend DIVERSE options from BOTH cities (Lahore AND Karachi):
    From Lahore:
    1. UET Lahore (Public, ~50,000-70,000 PKR, excellent CS program)
    2. COMSATS Lahore (Public, ~60,000-90,000 PKR, strong IT programs)
    3. FAST Lahore (Private, ~80,000-120,000 PKR, top CS program)
    From Karachi:
    4. NED University (Public, ~40,000-60,000 PKR, excellent engineering/CS)
    5. FAST Karachi (Private, ~80,000-120,000 PKR, top CS program)
    6. Karachi University (Public, ~30,000-50,000 PKR, affordable CS)
  → CRITICAL: Include universities from BOTH current city (Lahore) AND preferred city (Karachi)
  → DO NOT limit to only preferred city - student should see options from both locations

CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST - VERIFY EACH RECOMMENDATION:
Before including ANY university, ask yourself:
1. ✅ Is it in the correct city? 
   - Student current city: {user_profile.current_city}
   - Can move: {'YES' if user_profile.can_move_to_other_cities else 'NO'}
   - Preferred cities (if can move): {', '.join(user_profile.preferred_cities) if user_profile.preferred_cities else 'Any city'}
   - If student CAN move and has preferred cities: 
     * University must be from EITHER current city ({user_profile.current_city}) OR preferred cities ({', '.join(user_profile.preferred_cities) if user_profile.preferred_cities else 'any city'})
     * CRITICAL: Your FINAL list of recommendations MUST include universities from BOTH current city AND preferred cities
     * DO NOT create a list with only preferred cities - you MUST include current city universities too
     * Example: If student in Lahore willing to move to Islamabad, your 8 recommendations should include ~4 from Lahore and ~4 from Islamabad
   - If student CANNOT move: University must be from current city ({user_profile.current_city}) ONLY
2. ✅ Does it match university type? (Student wants: {user_profile.get_university_type_display()}) 
   - If "Private": University must be PRIVATELY-OWNED (NOT government-owned). NO public universities like UET, COMSATS, Punjab University, NUST, QAU, etc.
   - If "Public": University must be GOVERNMENT-OWNED. NO private universities like LUMS, FAST, IBA, etc.
   - If "Any": Can be either public or private
3. ✅ Is it ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR the student's field? (Student wants: {user_profile.preferred_field_of_study or ', '.join(user_profile.interests)}) 
   - If Arts/Design → Recommend NCA, BNU, etc. (NOT UET, COMSATS, NUST)
   - If Engineering → Recommend UET, NUST, COMSATS, etc. (NOT NCA, BNU)
   - If Business → Recommend LUMS, IBA, etc. (NOT UET, COMSATS)
4. ✅ Does student's {user_profile.intermediate_percentage or 'percentage'} meet admission requirements?
5. ✅ Do fees match affordability: {fee_constraint}?
6. ✅ Does it match additional requirements: {user_profile.additional_requirements or 'None'}?

If ANY answer is NO, DO NOT recommend that university!

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON array, no additional text before or after
2. Each recommendation must be UNIQUE (no duplicates)
3. Provide 6-10 diverse universities (minimum 6, preferably 8-10)
4. LOCATION DISTRIBUTION IS MANDATORY: If student can move and has preferred cities, you MUST split your recommendations between current city and preferred cities. Do NOT recommend all from one city only.
4. UNIVERSITY TYPE MATCHING IS CRITICAL: Student wants {user_profile.get_university_type_display()} 
   - If "Private": Include ONLY privately-owned universities (LUMS, FAST, IBA, SZABIST, BNU, UMT, Bahria, Riphah, etc.) - NO government universities
   - If "Public": Include ONLY government-owned universities (UET, COMSATS, Punjab University, NUST, QAU, NED, Karachi University, etc.) - NO private universities
   - If "Any": Can include both types
5. FIELD OF STUDY MATCHING IS CRITICAL: Student wants {user_profile.preferred_field_of_study or ', '.join(user_profile.interests)} - recommend universities ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR this field
6. VERIFY ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Student has {user_profile.intermediate_percentage or 'N/A'}% - ONLY recommend universities where this percentage meets/exceeds their admission requirements
7. Verify fee structures match the affordability range exactly
8. Include universities specifically strong in the student's field: {user_profile.preferred_field_of_study or ', '.join(user_profile.interests)}
9. Research actual current fees AND admission requirements for each university
10. Match at least 3-4 universities that are TOP choices for the student's specific field of study AND match admission requirements
11. DO NOT repeat the same universities - if you recommended one, don't recommend it again. Find other options.
12. CRITICAL: Before recommending any university, verify ALL criteria using the checklist above.
13. For Arts/Design in Lahore: MUST consider NCA, BNU - NOT engineering universities like UET, COMSATS
14. Be creative and comprehensive in finding universities that match ALL criteria
